## How it works

YouTubeDownloader uses the [Pafy](https://pythonhosted.org/Pafy/) library to receive the video data and then manipulates it. To make the GUI the tkinter library was used.

## Installation

With Python installed, run the following command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_or_

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then double click on the file **main.py**.

## Finally

Done! Now you are ready to download your favorite videos and music.
